I have a stable job in state government and have been in the position for over 6 years. I should be considered a very low risk borrower. <br>","credit_card","Credit Card Payoff","243xx","VA","23.41","0","Mar-1984","710","714","2","","","13","0","46957","67%","38","f","0.00","0.00","18898.5464318806","18315.43","15050.00","3848.55","0.0","0.0","0.0","Oct-2013","11241.88","","Jun-2020","764","760","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","",""

My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems.

I still would like to have the $7600.00 indicated in my account. The purpose of the loan is to procure added product and to help with small expansion at my greenhouse. I have a rotating account that provides enough for my normal expenses but would like to have additional funds for the year. Beginning January 1, 2012 I will start propagating our seeds and will grow the plants until April when we will open our store and start our selling season. During April, May, and June I sell 60k +. At the end of the season I pay back the loans I accumulate. I will have four employees working until the end of June or until we sell out. I appreciate the current investors and hope that I can reach my goal of the full loan amount. <br><br>Sincere Thanks<br><br><br> Borrower added on 12/14/11 > Recently an investor requested that I answer a question but when I follow the link log into the account and come to the question page there is no question posted.

Again I would like to let investors know what purpose this loan serves. <br>1. We are adding and employee this years Approx cost $2475.<br>2. We need funding for an urban renewal project for our city. Approx. cost $2800.<br>3. We are adding extra product this year because of demand. Approx. cost $2500.

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!""","debt_consolidation","Consolidation","641xx","MO","4.96","0","Dec-1995","700","704","3","","","6","0","10984","84.5%","9","f","0.00","0.00","18494.3499554904","18458.78","13000.00","5494.35","0.0","0.0","0.0","Apr-2015","5992.22","","May-2018","704","700","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","",""

I am also currently serving in the Army National Guard as an Executive Officer at the rank of 1st Lieutenant. I have honorably served for 7 years thus far. I do plan to serve another 13 years to complete a full 20 year military career.  I plan to use the funds to consolidate credit card debt and low balance fixed payment debts. My job is very stable as the financial services industry is in high demand of risk and compliance professionals in lieu of the numerous regulations imposed on the industry. And if needed, I always have the option of working full-time for the Army National Guard if for some reason my civilian job was no longer present. I will have no issues repaying this loan. After factoring in the monthly payment amount into my monthly budget, and I will have no issues meeting my monthly obligations.  Also, being a member of the U.S military, especially an officer, the Army will not allow any of my debts to go into a delinquency status. The military will garnish my wages and provide them to creditors until the debts are paid, which can be seen as a little extra security in terms of repayment.

I would like to thank all the investors who have already responded to my posted loan request. <br><br>I would like to provide more information in the hopes my full posted loan request is funded.<br><br>For five years, a snowball effect of financial mishaps and hardships has occurred. Some I could have avoided; some I could not. Bottom line, I have been unsuccessful gaining control of my debt because many of these debts are carried with high interest rates.  I have been unsuccessful negotiating lower interest rates with my creditors. I recently developed a spreadsheet listing all my debt. I had a rude awakening when I was able to see of my $721 monthly credit payments, $251 is toward interest (35%). <br><br>The purpose of requesting a $12,000 loan is to finance my high interest debt into a low interest loan. Through this loan, and paying off high interest debt, I project my monthly credit payments to be $675 with $130 towards interest (19%), allowing me the opportunity to comfortably pay off my debt in about three years. <br><br>I have been placing money into a savings account (difficult to access) for unplanned financial mishaps and hardships with the goal of avoiding the use of credit cards (I have cut them up!). <br><br>I have a secure job within a financially sound healthcare organization which I have been employed for ten years. Spring 2012, I enrolled in College with the goal of acquiring a degree in Accounting.  I am currently carrying a 3.88 GPA. I plan to graduate June 2013. Through College business classes I have learned how I CAN improve my financial situation.<br><br>I am loyal with my credit payments. However, I would prefer the opportunity to have most my monthly credit payments applied towards the principal so I can pay my debt off sooner.  Thank you so much for your time.<br>","debt_consolidation","DebtConsolidate","986xx","WA","9.73","0","Dec-1992","695","699","1","","","8","0","5525","80.1%","33","f","0.00","0.00","14479.0499935596","14479.05","12000.00","2479.05","0.0","0.0","0.0","Nov-2014","18.74","","Nov-2014","694","690","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","",""

This loan is for working capital for a whiskey bar and music venue. We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure. We just need some capital to really get things up off the ground.

I have paid off and purchased several cars.  I have paid off a dental loan in full.  In the past five years I have not missed a single payment or paid late on any of my credit lines.

Fewer payments, fewer payment dates and a lower interest rate means an easier repayment process for me to juggle and pay down more quickly.

So, as I mentioned in the title, I pretty much have free reign to do as I please.  It's been a <br><br>year now and it's time to get moving on it; there's 2000 square feet of nothingness back there.  I've applied the <br><br>appropriate herbicides to clear the wild brush and I've tilled and turned most of the land myself.  Now I need materials <br><br>and resources.  I'm currently taking bids for small pools.  Not sure if I'll go that route as they can get quite expensive, <br><br>but it's a bit of a dream.  I'm definitely doing a paverstone covered patio and some serious landscaping.  A moderate <br><br>fountain/pond is in the plans, as well. <br><br>I'm a good borrower because the trend of my life over the past five years would indicate such.  Five years ago, my credit <br><br>score was very poor.  It's currently plenty good enough for my listing to be accepted.  I've worked very hard since a short <br><br>tenure of financial ignorance to establish my creditworthiness.  I keep track of every dollar.  I can tell you the <br><br>remaining balances on all my debts, when payment on them is due, and the minimums required.  <br><br>I'm comfortable in the $650.00 payment range.  The initial lending club offer when I submitted my data was $25000.00 for <br><br>five years, paying $638.00 monthly.  I chose the alternate three-year, $20000.00 offer, paying $668.00 payment because it <br><br>just seemed like a better situation for all, including investors.<br><br>I've been in the same industry for four years now.  Work is stable and is expected to be for some time to come.<br><br>Thank you all for your consideration.

I received a loan through lending club back in May to help with one part of my debt consolidation plan.  As I have moved forward some teaser rates have expired on my cards and interest rates are really bogging me down in trying to get ahead on the revolving debt.<br><br>I, like many others have had some big expenses (unforseen), and took advantage of some teaser rates to try and get ahead.  I did not accomplish what I set out to do.  So I am reaching out to the lending club community again.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to negotiate with the banks, but they really won't budge at this juncture.<br><br>My plan is to consolidate 2 cards 1 with $7,000 (approx) outstanding and 1 with about $5,500 outanding into 1 payment (Lending Club) whereby the monthly amount I am paying back will be less than the monthly revolving.<br><br>I have been employed for 6 years and have a steady job at BOA.  I also plan to use any tax returns, etc to help accelerate paying this and my other debts off early.<br><br>I have paid every lending club payment on-time and will continue to do so.  Again, I would much rather take out the middle man and have a fixed amount to pay with a fixed term (this ensures I do not fall into this trap again).  Also, I have cut up the cards and have reverted to a strict budget with a &quot;cash&quot; only philosophy.  <br><br>Thank You again for your time and consideration!<br> Borrower added on 11/26/11 > Additional information...I have a 1900 month mortgage (waiting for HARP 2 for a possible refinance), 400 a month car payment, plus the revolving and utilities.  Consolidating this will give me the peace of mind of having a fixed amount over a fixed period.  <br>","debt_consolidation","Debt Consolidation 2","282xx","NC","23.7","0","Apr-1996","705","709","3","","","16","0","61575","57.1%","40","f","0.00","0.00","21119.6500379568","20978.85","15000.00","6119.65","0.0","0.0","0.0","Jun-2015","6203.71","","Jun-2015","684","680","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","",""

I made a mistake in having too many credit cards and I simply do not wish to go down that route again. With the situation of banks right now, they do not want to lend a large dollar amount to anyone regardless of credit history. I have always kept above a 720 credit score for as long as I have had credit history. More recently it has come down slightly, not because I have been late or anything, but because my balances are high. I ALWAYS pay my bills on time and have NEVER had any late or delinquent payments. I am a worthy borrower not only because of my credit history, but because I also believe that if you spend it, you must pay it back. I personally do not believe in not paying my bills. I have a full time VERY stable job and make decent money, the minimum payment on this loan is actually less than my minimum payments per month on all of my current credit cards, so there is no problem in you getting your investment back plus interest. I regard my credit scores very highly and I would not jepordize my credit history because I just decided I did not want to pay for things I purchased, that is quite immoral. I would simply like to have one payment and close out all the little cards so I can have a little piece of mind.

I have not defaulted, nor been late on my commitments.  My goal is to consolidate my debt through Lending Club and pay off outstanding debts because I want to make a plan toward eventual retirement in the next 12 years.  I do not want to enter retirement with debts.  I have a 401K at work which is putting aside small amounts for future reserves but to be debt free would allow me to set aside larger amounts for my future.  I am a safe investment, 5 years at my job, 11 years at my previous job and hoping to receive full funding for this loan.  I'm grateful for the opportunity Lending Club offers.  In this tumultuous economic time, more people are moving their money from the big banks to credit unions.  I hope all of America will become debt free and take themselves out of the the credit card game where nobody wins but the banks.

Also, we are paying a higher monthly amount on a car loan. By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration and  support. Your help  is much appreciated. Have a great day!<br>","other","Home improvement and car loan pay-off","958xx","CA","10.45","0","Apr-2005","670","674","1","45","","3","0","365","18.2%","7","f","0.00","0.00","2493.54","2493.54","992.43","1491.39","0.0","9.72","0.0","Jun-2013","138.53","","Jul-2020","649","645","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","",""

During the past several years I've created a trusted and solid reputation for myself in the the worlds of Television and Film. I continue to work successfully in Production and Post Sound with award winning clients including; American Film Institute, Bravo, Discovery and National Geographic.  I've refrained from adding credits to maintain anonymity, as my IMDB is quite extensive.  I am the go to Production and Post Sound Expert for many A-list and well known film makers.  My clientele base has grown steadily and I need to purchase a few pieces of equipment to keep up and reduce my overhead.  The elimination of that overhead will allow me to competitively bid on films and television shows, whether their budgets be large and more importantly small. The reduced need to Rent equipment to conduct business will give me access to a much larger market; specifically the myriad of independent films, reality television shows and documentaries produced in today's economy  Thank you and All my best.","small_business","Small Business Loan","917xx","CA","5.81","0","Nov-2000","735","739","0","","","2","0","6054","96.1%","7","f","0.00","0.00","6458.14","6458.14","2154.63","2989.53","0.0","1313.98","235.71","Aug-2012","643.58","","Oct-2016","584","580","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","",""

I always pay my bills on time (never miss payments). I'm afraid I don't have any fantastically interesting story here. While I clock in my 50-60 hours per week so that I can someday also offer loans here to other people, I just want consolidate my credit cards for 2 simple reasons: <br><br>1) to get everything under a fixed rate-- I don't trust the giant corporate lenders I owe money to or the whole idea of a &quot;variable&quot; rate anymore, with or without Dodd-Frank. <br><br>2) The tax payer bailed out the financial system. It occured to me that I would much rather pay interest to other human beings seeking an honest return on investment rather than giant banks whose reputations are currently tarnished for dishonesty and greed. <br><br>Fund my loan so I can cancel and cut up some credit cards, you earn interest--not Citigroup, Chase, or Amex!

The interest on the outstanding balance is currently 0%, but will increase to 18.99% next month. The proposed loan will have a more favorable pricing structure.  A majority of my revolving and some installment debt is the result of a large tax liability (capital gains). My financial advisor urged me to pull from all of my personal resources in order to pay the liability as soon as possible, so I used my savings (except for emergency fund) and some debt to pay the liability in full. One of my installment loans is related to an executive graduate program. My former employer paid for the tuition and related expenses, subject to me remaining with the organization for 2 years after graduation. If I were to leave prior to that time a pro-rated balance of the tuition was to be converted into a note payable. I accepted a new position prior to the two year period, and the balance was converted to a note. My current employer reimburses me for both the monthly payment on the note (approximately $472), and the remaining expenses associated with the executive degree. I am currently in the process of paying off all debt, which should be accomplished by the 1st quarter of 2013. I will continue to pay down the higher interest facilities, and then roll the amount I was paying on an obligation once it has been paid off to the next obligation (snowball effect). My monthly budget provides sufficient excess funds from which Im able to pay debt at accelerated rate. I have been in the finance industry for 12+ years, focusing on senior secured lending, leveraged transactions, workout and restructure, and more recently consultation on M&A activity (primarily purchasing distressed assets). My unique skill set affords me a great deal of flexibility in both times of economic expansion and contraction. I have never been late on a payment, let alone defaulted on an obligation. The proposed loan will allow me to repay a significant portion of my exiting debt priced at a higher rate, and accelerate my plan to be debt free w/in the next few years.

Some credit cards were at a 0% promotion and now have jumped to 24.99% APR. I am looking to consolidate my debt. My bills and rent are always paid on time. This will not only reduce my interest rate but consolidate my bills into one payment. My goal is to rent out this house as additional income on top of my full-time job. <br> Borrower added on 11/23/11 > To answer a few questions posed:<br><br>I have worked at my current place of employment for over 2 1/2 yrs. I pay all my bills on time and usually try to pay more than required. As stated above, I have two credit cards with @24.99% APR that I would like to pay off with the 18.25% loan.<br><br>The credit cards originally had a 0% APR for cash advances. This was used for a down payment on the house. It was not from frivolous spending. Before the cash advance, my credit cards had low balances which I'd pay off before the end of the month.<br><br>As for my monthly budget:<br><br>Housing cost: about $500 + $50 util. <br>Credit Cards: $500/mos. Which would be transferred to loan payments, when CC's are paid off with loan<br>Transportation: $100<br>Food/Misc.: $300<br><br>I hope this helps. Please feel free to send further questions.
